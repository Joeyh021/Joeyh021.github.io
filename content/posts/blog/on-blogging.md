I bought this domain a year ago today, with grand visions of writing interesting blog posts and whatever other cool shit it is people do with domains. Unfortunately all that ever happened was I threw together the crappiest HTML/CSS homepage ever (not a web dev btw), and used it to point to [my notes](https://joeyh.dev/notes). Inspired by the 15 quid I had to shell out to renew it, that has changed with a shiny new website and actual blog. Big things coming.
